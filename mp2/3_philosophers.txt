There are multiple results regarding this particular set of parameters.
The patterns are mixed, a potential cause might be that the script got random processer time.
In most cases, however, left-handed solution is faster than footman and Tanebaum's solution; footman is slowest in general.
Tanebaum's solution, however, as can be observed from the above outputs, can be the fastest; but in general, it's faster than footman.

The left hand is faster probably due to it has a guaranteed "eat" for the lefty (in my case the phiolosophers P-1).
The footman, however, might need to run till last guy and got locked out (as Semaphore is P-1, meaning only P-2 phiolosophers can be on the table
at the same time).
Tanebum, meanwhile, is comparatively unstable. It was supposed to be the fastest (and so it is in some cases).
[assume it's the fastest...]
Tanebum's solution's efficiency is due to the fact that, in the solution, phiolosophers cannot only eat when he gets the turn,
but also when his neighbor finishes eating.This allows for much higher concurrency than previous solutions and is therefore faster
then them as well.

*the fact that Tanebum is not consistantly the fastest is wierd... could be system is doing something else. 
*but the script takes up only 0.7Mb on my laptop
